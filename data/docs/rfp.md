**[BACKGROUND]{.underline}**

-   Barefoot is at risk of losing its title as the #1 Wine Brand due to
    category trends and competition. Barefoot must drive consideration
    by being seen as a brand that provides easy enjoyment because it's
    an uncomplicated choice: America's Most Awarded wine that's always
    delicious

-   [​]{.mark}At the category level, consumption is declining for the
    wine category as consumers choose to either abstain or consume
    drinks that better fit their moods and occasions (functional
    beverages, seltzers, spirits, RTD's).

-   To welcome new friends to wine and build new wine occasions,
    America's #1 wine brand partnered with America's #1 sport: NFL. This
    partnership allows Barefoot to build credibility with the NFL's
    large, engaged audience, as well as put wine at the center of a
    high-energy, social occasion.

-   Barefoot aims to align with emerging NFL fans and highlight the
    relationship between wine and football.

    -   Being that we're only beginning the third year of our NFL
        partnership, we're still working to create that strong
        association between Barefoot and the NFL.

**[SEASON 3 INSIGHT]{.underline}**

-   Season 3 saw successes with the NFL partnership, driving 2.6MM new
    users to the brand; however, the brand as a whole is still at risk
    of losing its #1 Wine Brand title due to category
    trends/competition.

-   Season 3 leaned into addressable video which drove incremental
    reach, but lacked a cultural element to drive greater
    association/consideration for Barefoot and NFL.

-   Barefoot leaned into brand partnerships with Simone Biles and on the
    ground Super Bowl activations with WAGs personalities.

-   Content partnerships saw success during Season 2 via MMM, which
    opens up opportunities for potential activation for Season 4.

-   Overall consideration peaked around 46% in Season 3 with
    opportunities to increase in season 4.

**[FLIGHTING]{.underline}**

8/18/25 -- 2/9/26

-   Tentpole Moments: NFL Regular Season (Sep -- Jan), Holidays (Nov --
    Dec), Super Bowl (Feb)

-   Flighting is split into two main periods ASOND (Aug -- Dec) and
    Jan/Feb.

**[BUDGET LEVEL]{.underline}**

-   \$500K - \$1MM Scalable

    -   Budgets are **[not]{.underline}** fluid across years

    -   While not prescriptive, general budgets has a flexible weight:
        81% ASOND / 19% Jan/Feb

**[CREATIVE]{.underline}**

-   Static: 970x90, 728x90, 300x250, 320x50, 640x360, 360x640

-   Video: 6s, 15s

**[AUDIENCE TARGET:]{.underline}**

-   Leverage all data available that allows us to reach NFL Growth
    Audience (Age 25-54, NFL interest, has consumed any wine or
    competitors wine P12, excluding solely BF drinkers p12).

-   The Growth NFL Audience is someone who drinks wine and/or dabbles in
    wine drinking and shows some interest in the NFL. They're looking to
    learn more about the game to engage socially about football. They're
    engaging with the NFL outside of watching games by going to NFL
    events, joining fantasy leagues, watching highlights online, etc.

-   When targeting Growth NFL audience, especially in the digital/social
    space, there will be a stronger focus on a female audience given
    that linear/streaming audiences have a higher composition of males.
    With the rise of "Swifties", WAGS, and record viewership from
    females over the past year, Barefoot has an opportunity to reach a
    younger/female audience to redefine enjoying wine during football
    occasions.

-   Competitive (Competitive set: Yellowtail, Sutter Home, Woodbridge,
    Cupcake, Josh Cellars, Cavit)
